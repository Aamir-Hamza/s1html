   <h3>Chemistry Assignment</h3> 
   <p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties, composition, and behavior of matter. It is a facinating filed that explores the building blocks of the univers</p>
   <h4>Chemical Elements</h4>
   <p>The periodic table is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each elemetn is represented by tis chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen and o for oxygen element are classified into groups and periods based on their properties</p>
   <h5>Chemical Equations</h5>
   <p>Chemical reactions are represented using checmical. Here's an example of chemical reaction</p>
   2H<sub>2</sub>+ O<sub>2</sub>âž¡2H<sub>2</sub>O
   <p>This equation represent the reaction between hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>) and oxygen gas (O<sub>2</sub>) to form water (H<sub>2</sub>O)</p>
   <h4>Important Conecpts</h4>
   <p>Stoichiometry is the calculation of reaction and products in chemical reaction. It involves balancing chemical equation to ensure mass and charge are conserved</p>
   subscript <sup>indiacte the number of atom of each element in a molecule, while <sup>superscript</sup> represent the charegs or the number of atoms in an ion</sup>
   <h4>Conclusion</h4>
   <p>Chemistry paly crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the compositionof the air we breath to the reaction that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives</p>
